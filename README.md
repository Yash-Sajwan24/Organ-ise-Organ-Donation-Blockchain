### About the project:
The proposed System
is faster, more secure and more scalable. The organ receiver and donor can be sure of the authenticity
of the other without hesitation. The Organ Donation System does not allow any third-party access. The
system eliminates the corruption in department of organ donation through a transparent system and the
patients will be able to get the organ before it is too late.



## Motivation

Organ donation being the most noble deed requires revolutionization. Our Project provides an efficient platform for potential organ doners and those who need the organs to connect. It uses Blockchain as its
underlying Technology. Blockchain Technology is as it is known a decentralized and distributed network which stores records that are immutable as in cannot be altered once saved.
