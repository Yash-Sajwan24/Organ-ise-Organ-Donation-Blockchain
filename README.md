## Motivation

Organ donation being the most noble deed requires revolutionization. Our Project provides an efficient platform for potential organ doners and those who need the organs to connect. It uses Blockchain as its
underlying Technology. Blockchain Technology is as it is known a decentralized and distributed network which stores records that are immutable as in cannot be altered once saved.
